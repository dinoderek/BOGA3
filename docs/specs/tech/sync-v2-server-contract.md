# Sync v2 Server Contract

# Part A — Server schema

The server is a typed mirror of the nine client entity tables. One
`app_public.<entity>` table per client Drizzle table; no projection function,
no event log, no per-row dispatch. Every write reaches the tables through the
push RPC (Part B); the server is otherwise not a write source.

## A.1 Ground rules

These invariants hold for every table below.

- **Server schema mirrors client.** One `app_public.<entity>` table per client
  Drizzle table for the nine user-owned entities.
- **Composite PK `(owner_user_id, id)`** on every table. Column order is
  owner-first so the canonical pull query (`where owner_user_id = … order by
  server_received_at`) leads with the PK column.
- **Composite FKs only.** Every cross-entity FK references the parent's
  composite PK `(owner_user_id, <parent_id>)`. No cross-owner references exist
  by construction.
- **All FKs are `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED`** (see A.5). Push transactions
  can write a child before its parent; constraints are checked at COMMIT.
- **Timestamps are `bigint` (epoch ms), not `timestamptz`.** The only
  `timestamptz` on these tables is `server_received_at` (server-set, the pull
  cursor axis — see B.4).
- **No `origin_scope_id` / `origin_source_id`.** Every row is per-user.
- **Minimal server-side validation.** The client is the only writer; the server
  validates nothing it cannot also be the cause of. Concretely:
    - **No CHECK constraints** on enum text (`sessions.status`,
      `exercise_sets.set_type`, `exercise_muscle_mappings.role`), numeric ranges
      (`order_index >= 0`, `weight > 0`, …), or text content, except the
      `exercise_definitions_load_input_mode_valid` CHECK introduced by M19. That
      two-value semantic field is consumed directly by analytics, so invalid
      values are rejected at both durable stores rather than interpreted.
    - **No NOT NULL beyond the wire envelope.** Domain columns are nullable when
      the client may legitimately write NULL. Structural columns
      (`owner_user_id`, `client_updated_at_ms`, the PK columns) stay NOT NULL.
    - **No content-validating triggers.** The only triggers are structural: the
      `server_received_at` touch on UPDATE, and the `owner_user_id` immutability
      guard (A.6.3).
  What the server *does* enforce is structural, not validation: PK uniqueness,
  the nine composite FKs (A.5), and the RLS policies (A.6).
  **No other uniqueness constraints.** The `(session_id, order_index)` /
  `(session_exercise_id, order_index)` slot uniqueness and the join-table pair
  uniqueness are **not** enforced as UNIQUE — they exist as **non-unique btree
  indexes** for query performance only. The invariants are client-enforced
  (Part B; see B.10).
- **RLS:** `owner_user_id = auth.uid()` for select/insert/update/delete plus a
  restrictive `client_id IS NULL` policy, identical shape per table (A.6).
  Normal BoGa app sessions have no OAuth `client_id` and retain sync access;
  OAuth agent credentials cannot call the tables or sync RPCs directly.
- **Typed columns only — no `extras jsonb`.** Every entity column lands as a
  typed server column. There is no `extras` blob anywhere (schema, wire,
  drift checker).
- **Tombstones preserve the full row; undelete is lossless.** A delete sets
  `deleted_at = Date.now()` but clears nothing else. There is **no separate
  `deleted boolean` column** — `deleted_at IS NOT NULL` is the only tombstone
  marker, present on every entity table including the join tables. See A.1.1.
- **Hard cut from v1.** The clean-room migration drops every v1 server object
  (the M13/M14 projection family, `sync_events_ingest`(+`_impl`),
  `sync_apply_projection_event`, the device/ingested-events tables, the eight
  legacy entity tables, the in-flight user-scoped-PK shape) and recreates the
  v2 shape clean. The hosted DB is wiped post-merge; there is no rollback path.
- **Future-clock clamp.** The push RPC clamps incoming `client_updated_at_ms`
  to `min(incoming, now_ms() + 5 * 60 * 1000)` — silently storing the clamped
  value for timestamps more than five minutes in the future. This stops a
  fast-clock client from writing an unbeatable LWW value. Clamping is silent so
  a transient NTP glitch does not surface as a sync error.
- **Migration-in-flight contract.** Schema migrations against
  `app_public.<entity>` tables are **additive-only during normal operation**
  (`ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN …`). Destructive operations need a quiesced deploy
  window (out of scope for v2 ship). The hard-cut migration runs against a wiped
  DB, so additive-only does not apply to it.

> **Build note (verified).** A.1's schema rules are confirmed against the
> clean-room migration: composite PKs, `bigint` timestamps, `deleted_at bigint`
> on all nine tables, only the named M19 load-mode CHECK, no `extras` column, no `deleted`
> boolean, and the non-unique form of every slot/pair index. The drift checker

### A.1.1 LWW and undelete semantics

LWW (last-writer-wins) is the conflict-resolution rule for every entity column,
keyed on `client_updated_at_ms`. It applies uniformly to live writes, deletes,
and undeletes — there is no special-case path. **Deletion is `deleted_at` going
non-null; undeletion is `deleted_at` going back to null.**

#### A.1.1.1 The rule

For an incoming write to `(owner_user_id, id)` with
`client_updated_at_ms = T_in` against a stored row with
`client_updated_at_ms = T_db`:

- If `T_in <= T_db`: the write is a **no-op** at the row level. (The push RPC
  may still ack the row to clear the client's dirty bit; no columns change.)
- If `T_in > T_db`: every column in the payload is written verbatim, including
  `deleted_at`. There is no per-column comparison; the unit of LWW is the row.

A consequence: `deleted_at` can flip from a timestamp back to `null` purely by
LWW. That is undelete.

#### A.1.1.2 The two undelete scenarios

**Scenario A — server has a newer tombstone, client locally undeletes (older).**
Device 1 deletes row X at T=100 (server: `deleted_at=100, T_db=100`); Device 2,
offline with a stale clock, undeletes at T=90 and pushes. `T_in=90 < T_db=100`,
so the write is a no-op; the server keeps the tombstone and the next pull tells
Device 2 the row is deleted. **The undelete loses.** Acknowledged v2
trade-off of trusting client clocks.

**Scenario B — client has a newer undelete, server has an older tombstone.**
Device 1 deletes row X at T=100 (`deleted_at=100, T_db=100`); a later write at
T=200 sets `deleted_at=null` with a full payload and pushes. `T_in=200 >
T_db=100`, so every column overwrites the stored row including
`deleted_at=null`. **The row is fully restored — undelete by LWW.**

#### A.1.1.3 Reuse of `id` is the only practical undelete path

Scenario B occurs via a future "restore from history" UI re-emitting the
original id with a fresh `client_updated_at_ms`, a narrow-window id-reuse bug,
or a test fixture. All converge on the same wire shape and LWW resolution; no
special API is needed.

## A.2 Per-entity mapping

Notation: "Server type" is the Postgres type; "Null" `NO`=not null, `YES`=
nullable; "Indexed" names a standalone btree index; "FK" gives the composite FK
target. All FKs are `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED`.

Every entity table additionally carries these **identical** server columns
(not present in any client schema):

| Server column | Type | Null | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `owner_user_id` | `uuid` | NO | `auth.uid()` | Row owner; part of PK; `references auth.users(id) on delete cascade`. |
| `client_updated_at_ms` | `bigint` | NO | — | Client wall-clock at write; the LWW key. No CHECK. |
| `server_received_at` | `timestamptz` | NO | `now()` | Server-set on every insert/update; the pull cursor's monotonic axis. |

Every table also gets the **identical** index
`<table>_owner_received_idx` on `(owner_user_id, server_received_at)` and the
**identical** triggers `<table>_touch_server_received_at` (BEFORE UPDATE,
`WHEN (NEW IS DISTINCT FROM OLD)`, sets `server_received_at = now()`) and
`<table>_owner_user_id_immutable` (A.6.3). These are not repeated per entity
below.

> **Build note (verified).** All three universal columns, the
> `<table>_owner_received_idx` index, and both triggers exist on all nine
> tables in the clean-room migration; the drift checker asserts the index and
> both triggers per entity.

### A.2.1 `gyms`

Source: `apps/mobile/src/data/schema/gyms.ts`.

| Client column | Server column | Server type | Null | Indexed | FK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `id` | `text` | NO | — | part of PK |
| `name` | `name` | `text` | NO | yes (`gyms_name_idx`) | — |
| `createdAt` | `created_at` | `bigint` | NO | — | — |
| `updatedAt` | `updated_at` | `bigint` | NO | — | — |
| `deletedAt` | `deleted_at` | `bigint` | YES | yes (`gyms_deleted_at_idx`) | — |
| `latitude` | `latitude` | `double precision` | YES | — | — |
| `longitude` | `longitude` | `double precision` | YES | — | — |
| `coordinateAccuracyM` | `coordinate_accuracy_m` | `double precision` | YES | — | — |
| `coordinatesUpdatedAt` | `coordinates_updated_at` | `bigint` | YES | — | — |

PK `(owner_user_id, id)`. No CHECK constraints.

> **Build note (verified).** The four M15 carry-over coordinate columns
> (`latitude`, `longitude`, `coordinate_accuracy_m`, `coordinates_updated_at`)
> are present on the as-built `app_public.gyms` table because the client schema
> carries them. The push RPC writes them and the pull RPC projects them — the
> round-trip is symmetric. Any `gyms`-touching wire logic must include all four.

### A.2.2 `sessions`

Source: `apps/mobile/src/data/schema/sessions.ts`.

| Client column | Server column | Server type | Null | Default | Indexed | FK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `id` | `text` | NO | — | — | part of PK |
| `gymId` | `gym_id` | `text` | YES | — | yes (`sessions_gym_id_idx`) | `(owner_user_id, gym_id) → gyms(owner_user_id, id)` `on delete set null` deferred |
| `status` | `status` | `text` | NO | `'active'` | yes (`sessions_status_idx`) | — |
| `startedAt` | `started_at` | `bigint` | NO | — | — | — |
| `completedAt` | `completed_at` | `bigint` | YES | — | yes (`sessions_completed_at_idx`) | — |
| `durationSec` | `duration_sec` | `integer` | YES | — | — | — |
| `deletedAt` | `deleted_at` | `bigint` | YES | — | yes (`sessions_deleted_at_idx`) | — |
| `createdAt` | `created_at` | `bigint` | NO | — | — | — |
| `updatedAt` | `updated_at` | `bigint` | NO | — | — | — |

PK `(owner_user_id, id)`. No CHECK constraints — the legacy
`('draft','active','completed')` CHECK on `status` is dropped.

### A.2.3 `session_exercises`

Source: `apps/mobile/src/data/schema/session-exercises.ts`.

| Client column | Server column | Server type | Null | Indexed | FK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `id` | `text` | NO | — | part of PK |
| `sessionId` | `session_id` | `text` | NO | yes (`session_exercises_session_id_idx`) | `(owner_user_id, session_id) → sessions(owner_user_id, id)` `on delete cascade` deferred |
| `exerciseDefinitionId` | `exercise_definition_id` | `text` | YES | yes (`session_exercises_exercise_definition_id_idx`) | `(owner_user_id, exercise_definition_id) → exercise_definitions(owner_user_id, id)` `on delete no action` deferred |
| `orderIndex` | `order_index` | `integer` | NO | — | — |
| `name` | `name` | `text` | NO | — | — |
| `machineName` | `machine_name` | `text` | YES | — | — |
| `createdAt` | `created_at` | `bigint` | NO | — | — |
| `updatedAt` | `updated_at` | `bigint` | NO | — | — |
| `deletedAt` | `deleted_at` | `bigint` | YES | yes (`session_exercises_deleted_at_idx`) | — |

PK `(owner_user_id, id)`. No CHECK constraints.
**Non-unique** partial btree index
`session_exercises_session_order_active_idx` on
`(owner_user_id, session_id, order_index) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` —
performance only; slot uniqueness is client-enforced (B.10 #1).

### A.2.4 `exercise_sets`

Source: `apps/mobile/src/data/schema/exercise-sets.ts`.

| Client column | Server column | Server type | Null | Default | Indexed | FK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `id` | `text` | NO | — | — | part of PK |
| `sessionExerciseId` | `session_exercise_id` | `text` | NO | — | yes (`exercise_sets_session_exercise_id_idx`) | `(owner_user_id, session_exercise_id) → session_exercises(owner_user_id, id)` `on delete cascade` deferred |
| `orderIndex` | `order_index` | `integer` | NO | — | — | — |
| `weightValue` | `weight_value` | `text` | NO | `''` | — | — |
| `repsValue` | `reps_value` | `text` | NO | `''` | — | — |
| `setType` | `set_type` | `text` | YES | — | — | — |
| `plannedWeightValue` | `planned_weight_value` | `text` | YES | — | — | — |
| `plannedRepsValue` | `planned_reps_value` | `text` | YES | — | — | — |
| `plannedSetType` | `planned_set_type` | `text` | YES | — | — | — |
| `performanceStatus` | `performance_status` | `text` | YES | — | — | — |
| `createdAt` | `created_at` | `bigint` | NO | — | — | — |
| `updatedAt` | `updated_at` | `bigint` | NO | — | — | — |
| `deletedAt` | `deleted_at` | `bigint` | YES | — | yes (`exercise_sets_deleted_at_idx`) | — |

PK `(owner_user_id, id)`. No CHECK constraints (including `set_type`).
**Non-unique** partial index `exercise_sets_session_exercise_order_active_idx`
on `(owner_user_id, session_exercise_id, order_index) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`
— performance only; slot uniqueness is client-enforced (B.10 #2).

### A.2.5 `exercise_definitions`

Source: `apps/mobile/src/data/schema/exercise-definitions.ts`.

| Client column | Server column | Server type | Null | Indexed | FK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `id` | `text` | NO | — | part of PK |
| `name` | `name` | `text` | NO | yes (`exercise_definitions_name_idx`) | — |
| `loadInputMode` | `load_input_mode` | `text` | NO | — | — |
| `deletedAt` | `deleted_at` | `bigint` | YES | yes (`exercise_definitions_deleted_at_idx`) | — |
| `createdAt` | `created_at` | `bigint` | NO | — | — |
| `updatedAt` | `updated_at` | `bigint` | NO | — | — |

PK `(owner_user_id, id)`. `load_input_mode` is constrained to `total_load` or
`per_side_load`; it describes load distribution, not equipment. `id` may be a slug
(`seed:bench-press`) or a hex token; the server treats it as opaque text.

### A.2.6 `exercise_muscle_mappings`

Source: `apps/mobile/src/data/schema/exercise-muscle-mappings.ts`.

| Client column | Server column | Server type | Null | Indexed | FK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `id` | `text` | NO | — | part of PK |
| `exerciseDefinitionId` | `exercise_definition_id` | `text` | NO | yes (`exercise_muscle_mappings_exercise_definition_id_idx`) | `(owner_user_id, exercise_definition_id) → exercise_definitions(owner_user_id, id)` `on delete cascade` deferred |
| `muscleGroupId` | `muscle_group_id` | `text` | NO | yes (`exercise_muscle_mappings_muscle_group_id_idx`) | `(owner_user_id, muscle_group_id) → muscle_groups(owner_user_id, id)` `on delete cascade` deferred (A.2.9) |
| `weight` | `weight` | `double precision` | NO | — | — |
| `role` | `role` | `text` | YES | — | — |
| `createdAt` | `created_at` | `bigint` | NO | — | — |
| `updatedAt` | `updated_at` | `bigint` | NO | — | — |
| `deletedAt` | `deleted_at` | `bigint` | YES | yes (`exercise_muscle_mappings_deleted_at_idx`) | — |

PK `(owner_user_id, id)`. No CHECK constraints (including `role`, `weight`).
**Non-unique** btree index `exercise_muscle_mappings_exercise_muscle_idx` on
`(owner_user_id, exercise_definition_id, muscle_group_id)` — pair uniqueness is
client-enforced (B.10 #3). `deleted_at` present so the LWW upsert path is
uniform; local readers filter `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`.

#### A.2.6.1 `muscle_group_id` is a synced-parent FK

`muscle_groups` is one of the nine user-owned synced entities (A.2.9), seeded as
a starter catalog and then synced per-user like `exercise_definitions`. So
`muscle_group_id` is **not** opaque text: it is a real composite FK into
`app_public.muscle_groups(owner_user_id, id)` (constraint
`exercise_muscle_mappings_muscle_group_fk`, `on delete cascade`, deferred —
listed in A.5.2). Because the parent is Layer 0 and the mapping is Layer 1, a
bootstrap/restore pulls the muscle group before the mapping, so the FK holds
under enforcement. There is no `untyped_text_references` exemption in
`sync-extras.json` for this column anymore — the drift checker enforces the
typed-column and FK rule on it like any other.

### A.2.7 `exercise_tag_definitions`

Source: `apps/mobile/src/data/schema/exercise-tag-definitions.ts`.

| Client column | Server column | Server type | Null | Indexed | FK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `id` | `text` | NO | — | part of PK |
| `exerciseDefinitionId` | `exercise_definition_id` | `text` | NO | yes (`exercise_tag_definitions_exercise_definition_id_idx`) | `(owner_user_id, exercise_definition_id) → exercise_definitions(owner_user_id, id)` `on delete cascade` deferred |
| `name` | `name` | `text` | NO | — | — |
| `normalizedName` | `normalized_name` | `text` | NO | — | — |
| `deletedAt` | `deleted_at` | `bigint` | YES | yes (`exercise_tag_definitions_deleted_at_idx`) | — |
| `createdAt` | `created_at` | `bigint` | NO | — | — |
| `updatedAt` | `updated_at` | `bigint` | NO | — | — |

PK `(owner_user_id, id)`. No CHECK constraints. **Non-unique** partial index
`exercise_tag_definitions_exercise_normalized_active_idx` on
`(owner_user_id, exercise_definition_id, normalized_name) WHERE deleted_at IS
NULL` — normalized-name uniqueness is client-enforced (B.10 #4).

### A.2.8 `session_exercise_tags`

Source: `apps/mobile/src/data/schema/session-exercise-tags.ts`.

| Client column | Server column | Server type | Null | Indexed | FK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `id` | `text` | NO | — | part of PK |
| `sessionExerciseId` | `session_exercise_id` | `text` | NO | yes (`session_exercise_tags_session_exercise_id_idx`) | `(owner_user_id, session_exercise_id) → session_exercises(owner_user_id, id)` `on delete cascade` deferred |
| `exerciseTagDefinitionId` | `exercise_tag_definition_id` | `text` | NO | yes (`session_exercise_tags_exercise_tag_definition_id_idx`) | `(owner_user_id, exercise_tag_definition_id) → exercise_tag_definitions(owner_user_id, id)` `on delete cascade` deferred |
| `createdAt` | `created_at` | `bigint` | NO | — | — |
| `deletedAt` | `deleted_at` | `bigint` | YES | yes (`session_exercise_tags_deleted_at_idx`) | — |

PK `(owner_user_id, id)`. No CHECK constraints. **Non-unique** btree index
`session_exercise_tags_pair_idx` on
`(owner_user_id, session_exercise_id, exercise_tag_definition_id)` — pair
uniqueness is client-enforced (B.10 #5). This is the one entity with no client
`updated_at`; on the server it still carries the universal
`client_updated_at_ms` / `server_received_at` envelope columns.

### A.2.9 `muscle_groups`

Source: `apps/mobile/src/data/schema/muscle-groups.ts`. A per-user synced
taxonomy modeled on `exercise_definitions` (A.2.5): system-seeded as a starter
catalog, then synced per-user. It is a **Layer 0** entity (no FK dependencies)
and the FK parent of `exercise_muscle_mappings.muscle_group_id` (A.2.6, A.5.2).

| Client column | Server column | Server type | Null | Indexed | FK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `id` | `text` | NO | — | part of PK |
| `displayName` | `display_name` | `text` | NO | yes (`muscle_groups_display_name_idx`) | — |
| `familyName` | `family_name` | `text` | NO | yes (`muscle_groups_family_name_idx`) | — |
| `sortOrder` | `sort_order` | `integer` | NO | yes (`muscle_groups_sort_order_idx`) | — |
| `isEditable` | `is_editable` | `integer` | NO | — | — |
| `createdAt` | `created_at` | `bigint` | NO | — | — |
| `updatedAt` | `updated_at` | `bigint` | NO | — | — |
| `deletedAt` | `deleted_at` | `bigint` | YES | yes (`muscle_groups_deleted_at_idx`) | — |

PK `(owner_user_id, id)`. **Zero CHECK constraints** on the server (the
no-server-validation rule, A.1): the client-side `sort_order >= 0` and
`is_editable in (0,1)` guards stay client-only. The client seeds stable ids
(e.g. `chest_sternal`); the server treats `id` as opaque text. The two
client-only bookkeeping columns (`local_dirty`, `local_updated_at_ms`) never
cross the wire (A.3).

## A.3 Local schema additions (mechanism)

Sync v2 adds local-only sync-bookkeeping columns to the nine client tables.
They are set/cleared by the sync engine and **never travel on the wire**. The
canonical names and types are owned by Part B (B.9): `local_dirty` and
`local_updated_at_ms` on each entity table, plus singleton state on
`sync_runtime_state`. The schema-side mechanism is:

1. Local-only columns are registered in
   `apps/mobile/src/data/schema/sync-extras.json` under
   `exemptions.local_only_columns`.
2. The drift checker (A.7) skips any client column listed there.
3. The push serialiser (B.3) omits any local-only column from the wire.

**Server-first deploy is unconditional for every schema addition.** Every new
entity column lands on the server (a deployed migration) *before* the client.
A client that ships a typed column ahead of its server counterpart fails the
drift check at PR time. See A.9 for the worked example.

`sync-extras.json` shape:

```jsonc
{
  "exemptions": {
    "local_only_columns": ["local_dirty", "local_updated_at_ms"]
  }
}
```

> **Build note (verified).** The as-built `sync-extras.json` matches: only the
> two `local_only_columns` remain. There is no `untyped_text_references` entry —
> the former `muscleGroupId` waiver was removed when `muscle_groups` became a
> typed synced entity (A.2.9) and `muscle_group_id` gained its real FK (A.5.2),
> so the checker now enforces the typed-column and FK rule on that column like
> any other. The drift checker still tolerates an optional `server_only_columns`
> exemption list (none currently used).

### A.3.1 `deleted_at` columns

All nine tables carry `deleted_at` (`bigint`, nullable) plus a
`<table>_deleted_at_idx` index. The tables that previously lacked it on the
client (`gyms`, `session_exercises`, `exercise_sets`,
`exercise_muscle_mappings`, `session_exercise_tags`) gained it in the v2 build
wave; `sessions`, `exercise_definitions`, `exercise_tag_definitions` already
had it; `muscle_groups` gained it when it became a synced entity (A.2.9).

## A.5 Deferrable foreign keys

### A.5.1 What `INITIALLY DEFERRED` means

With `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED`, FK checks are postponed to COMMIT. Inside
one transaction a child may be inserted before its parent, or
`session_id`/`sessions.id` updated in either order, without an intermediate
violation. At COMMIT all FKs are re-checked; any unsatisfied constraint rolls
back the entire transaction. From the client's view the push RPC is atomic per
batch.

### A.5.2 The nine deferrable FKs

All nine declared `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED`. Migration template:

```sql
constraint <name>
  foreign key (owner_user_id, <child_col>)
  references app_public.<parent>(owner_user_id, id)
  on delete <action>
  deferrable initially deferred
```

### A.5.3 Child arriving with no parent

If a child's parent is in the same batch, deferral covers it (COMMIT finds the
parent). If the parent is **neither in the batch nor already on the server**,
COMMIT fails and the push RPC rolls back with an error. This is a **Part B
batching-invariant violation, not a normal occurrence** — B's batching must
guarantee every dirty child ships with its dirty ancestors (B.10 #6). The
COMMIT-time failure is a defense-in-depth backstop only; there is no retry path.

## A.6 RLS policies

### A.6.1 Universal shape

Identical for all nine tables (substitute `<table>`):

```sql
alter table app_public.<table> enable row level security;

create policy <table>_owner_select on app_public.<table>
  for select to authenticated using (owner_user_id = auth.uid());
create policy <table>_owner_insert on app_public.<table>
  for insert to authenticated with check (owner_user_id = auth.uid());
create policy <table>_owner_update on app_public.<table>
  for update to authenticated
  using (owner_user_id = auth.uid()) with check (owner_user_id = auth.uid());
create policy <table>_owner_delete on app_public.<table>
  for delete to authenticated using (owner_user_id = auth.uid());

create policy <table>_direct_app_only on app_public.<table>
  as restrictive for all to authenticated
  using (((select auth.jwt()) ->> 'client_id') is null)
  with check (((select auth.jwt()) ->> 'client_id') is null);
```

The four permissive owner policies preserve the normal application contract.
The restrictive policy is ANDed with them and distinguishes normal app sessions
from Supabase OAuth agent sessions. Agent reads are available only through the
dedicated BoGa3 API, which live-validates the OAuth grant and performs explicit
owner-filtered service reads. This protects both direct table routes and the
`security invoker` sync RPCs from agent-token use.

### A.6.2 Why no service-role policies

The push/pull RPCs are `security invoker` (see Build note below), so the
`authenticated` policies apply to RPC writes and to direct client access alike.
`service_role` grants exist for ops scripts only; RLS is bypassed for
`service_role` by Postgres convention.

> **Build note — DRIFT (doc-said-X → code-is-Y).** The former t1 §6.2 / t2 §1
> described the push/pull RPCs as `security definer`. The as-built
> `app_public.sync_push` and `app_public.sync_pull` are both
> **`security invoker`** — RLS evaluates as the calling `authenticated` user,
> which is why the universal `authenticated` policies are sufficient and no

> policy's `qual`/`with_check` against a checked-in fixture so an
> `owner_user_id = auth.uid()` → `true` regression or an OAuth-boundary removal
> fails CI.

### A.6.3 Immutability of `owner_user_id`

A `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger on every table guards `owner_user_id` against silent
re-homing. The body is NULL-safe and refuses NULL `auth.uid()`:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION app_public.enforce_owner_user_id_immutable()
RETURNS trigger LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
BEGIN
  IF auth.uid() IS NULL THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'auth.uid() is NULL; owner_user_id check cannot proceed';
  END IF;
  IF NEW.owner_user_id IS DISTINCT FROM OLD.owner_user_id THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'owner_user_id is immutable';
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END $$;
```

`IS DISTINCT FROM` (not `<>`) plus the explicit `auth.uid() IS NULL` guard
closes the three-valued-logic bypass that `<>` left open. Trigger name
convention: `<table>_owner_user_id_immutable`. This is the only trigger that
touches row content; it is an authorisation boundary, not validation.

> **Build note (verified).** The as-built function body matches verbatim. The
> drift checker reads `pg_proc.prosrc`, normalises and SHA-256-hashes it, and
> asserts it against `check-sync-schema-drift.fixtures.json`.

## A.7 Drift-detection mechanism

### A.7.1 Choice

**DB-to-DB introspection on both sides.** The checker spins up the local
Supabase Postgres (server side) and an in-memory SQLite materialised from the
Drizzle schema (client side), introspects live catalogs
(`information_schema`/`pg_catalog`/`pg_policies`/`pg_proc`/`pg_trigger` on
Postgres; `pragma table_info`/`index_list`/`foreign_key_list` on SQLite), and
diffs. Drizzle's `getTableConfig` metadata is a tie-breaker only (A.7.6).

- **Server side:** `supabase db reset --local` applies every migration from
  scratch — what ends up in `information_schema` is what production gets.
- **Client side:** `drizzle-kit export` emits the schema DDL, replayed into a
  fresh `better-sqlite3` `:memory:` database.

Location: `apps/mobile/scripts/check-sync-schema-drift.ts`. Command:
`npm run check:sync-drift`. Wired into `quality-slow.sh backend`.

### A.7.3 Algorithm (summary)

1. Reset the local Postgres (apply all migrations) unless `--skip-reset`.
2. `drizzle-kit export` → in-memory SQLite; introspect via PRAGMAs.
3. Derive `ENTITY_TABLES` = every `app_public` table with an `owner_user_id`
   column (do **not** hardcode the count — there are nine today — A.7.7).
4. Per entity: walk client→server (every client column must map to a typed
   server column of compatible type, unless `local_only` or
   `untyped_text_references`), and server→client (a server column with no client
   counterpart warns, or fails under `--strict`). Then run the **4f sanity
   checks**: `<entity>_owner_received_idx` present; both structural triggers
   present; RLS enabled with the four named policies whose `qual`/`with_check`
   hashes match the fixture; only the named M19 load-mode CHECK; no `extras` column; no
   `deleted` boolean.
5. Run the A.7.7 topological FK-order assertion.

Type-compatibility map (narrow): `text`↔`text`; client `integer`↔`int4`|`int8`;
client `real`↔`float8`|`numeric`. Nullability and default-expression equality
are **not** compared. The 4f sanity checks ARE strict (they assert A.1).

### A.7.4 Failure output / exit codes

- `0` — no drift, no warnings.
- `1` — drift (client column without server counterpart; or an A.1 ground-rule
  regression such as a CHECK constraint appearing). The output lists the
  entity's server columns and a `alter table … add column …` fix template,
  noting server-first deploy is unconditional.
- `2` — server has columns absent on the client (warn-only by default; promoted
  to `1` under `--strict`, which the slow gate uses).

### A.7.6 Drizzle metadata (tie-breaker only)

`getTableConfig` reliably exposes column names, wire names, base type,
nullability, FK targets, index tuples, and PK tuples. It is unreliable for SQL
`DEFAULT` expressions, `text({ enum })` literal sets, the integer `mode`
discriminator (`timestamp_ms`/`boolean`), generated columns, and post-`ALTER`
column ordering. For those, the in-memory SQLite catalog is authoritative; the
`mode` discriminator is read directly off the column builder
(`column.config.mode`).

### A.7.7 Topological FK-order assertion

The push batch builder (B.3.4) walks the entity tables in **layered**
topological order. The checker asserts the hardcoded layering in
`apps/mobile/src/sync/topo-order.ts` is consistent with the live FK graph:

```ts
export const TOPO_LAYERS: readonly (readonly string[])[] = [
  ['gyms', 'exercise_definitions', 'muscle_groups'],                    // Layer 0
  ['sessions', 'exercise_muscle_mappings', 'exercise_tag_definitions'], // Layer 1
  ['session_exercises'],                                                // Layer 2
  ['exercise_sets', 'session_exercise_tags'],                           // Layer 3
];
```

Each layer must satisfy (a) **no intra-layer FK** and (b) **every FK points to a
strictly earlier layer or is a self-edge**. The assertion:

1. Build `layer(table)` from `TOPO_LAYERS`.
2. Derive `ENTITY_TABLES` from the live schema (every `app_public` table with
   `owner_user_id`).
3. Membership: every entity appears exactly once in `TOPO_LAYERS` and vice
   versa; mismatch → FAIL.
4. For every FK edge `child → parent`: skip self-edges; if
   `layer(parent) >= layer(child)` → FAIL (names both endpoints).

> **Build note (verified).** `exercise_tag_definitions` is in **Layer 1**, not
> Layer 0, because it FKs into `exercise_definitions` (Layer 0) and an
> intra-layer FK is forbidden. `muscle_groups` is in **Layer 0**: it declares no
> FK to any other entity and is the parent of `exercise_muscle_mappings`
> (Layer 1, via `muscle_group_id`), so the child's FK points to a strictly
> earlier layer. The as-built `topo-order.ts`, the `sync_pull` SQL `case` (B.4),
> and the `sync-v2-pull-fk-closure.sh` partition assertion all encode this.
> Self-edges are allowed (a future `replaced_by_id` self-FK would be
> deferred-safe in one batch); same-layer cross-table FKs are forbidden because
> B.3.4.1's "any intra-layer order is safe" depends on it.

## A.8 Agent-reminder mechanism

The client-schema-drift rule lives in `docs/specs/05-data-model.md`
("Client schema drift rule (Sync v2)") because that file is always-loaded for
agents and already owns the sync-impact gate. The rule requires a paired,
deployed-first server migration for any new domain column on the nine entity
tables, enforced by the drift checker. It does not apply to adding a value to an
existing column (the column exists on both sides; the server stores arbitrary
text per A.1).

## A.9 Worked example — add `notes text` to `exercise_sets`

Server-first, two PRs in order:

1. **Server PR (lands first).** Migration
   `alter table app_public.exercise_sets add column notes text;`. Merge,
   deploy, confirm healthy. Older clients leave the column NULL.
2. **Client PR (lands second).** Add `notes: text('notes')` to
   `exercise-sets.ts`, `drizzle-kit generate` the local migration, run
   `npm run check:sync-drift` (passes — both sides have the column), update read
   code, ship. The push serialiser then emits `notes` under `fields`
   automatically because it closes over the typed server-column list.

The developer never edits a projection function, wires an outbox event type,
updates multiple API-contract docs, or coordinates across service repos.

# Part B — Push/pull RPC protocol

Two PostgREST RPCs under `app_public`. Both POST; both `security invoker` so
`owner_user_id` is derived from the JWT via RLS and never sent on the wire.

| RPC | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `sync_push` (`POST /rest/v1/rpc/sync_push`) | Upload a batch of dirty rows; server upserts with LWW in one transaction. |
| `sync_pull` (`POST /rest/v1/rpc/sync_pull`) | Download rows newer than a per-layer cursor, ordered by `(server_received_at, owner_user_id, type, id)`. |

There is no third "snapshot" RPC (snapshot is `sync_pull` with `cursor=null`),
no event log, no sequence numbers, no device ids, no batch ids, no `sent_at`
clock. **The data is the event.**

**Bigint serialization (B.1).** All `bigint` columns and
`client_updated_at_ms` cross the wire as JSON integers, never strings (epoch-ms
< 2^53 fits in a JS Number).

> **Build note (verified).** The bundled PostgREST (CLI pin) returns `bigint` as
> a JSON integer by default; no role-config change is required.
> `supabase/tests/sync-push-contract.sh` asserts a stored `client_updated_at_ms`
> and `created_at` return as JSON numbers, and that `sync_push`'s
> `server_received_at` returns as an ISO-8601 string.

## B.2 Wire types (shared)

### B.2.1 `Entity` envelope

Every row — push request and pull response — uses the same shape. The envelope
carries the LWW key; `fields` carries every typed column (including
`deleted_at`).

```json
{
  "type": "exercise_sets",
  "id": "01HXYZ...ULID",
  "client_updated_at_ms": 1733000000123,
  "fields": {
    "session_exercise_id": "01HX...",
    "order_index": 0,
    "weight_value": "100",
    "reps_value": "8",
    "set_type": "rir_2",
    "created_at": 1732999999000,
    "updated_at": 1733000000123,
    "deleted_at": null
  }
}
```

- `type` — one of the nine entity names (plural, snake_case), matching the
  Part A table names.
- `id` — client-assigned (ULID for user rows, slug for seeds), stable forever.
- `client_updated_at_ms` — epoch ms, the LWW key, `>= 0`, produced by the
  monotonicity guard (B.8).
- `fields` — per-entity typed columns; keys are wire-canonical snake_case
  matching A.2. The client MUST emit every typed column for the entity (JSON
  null for nullable columns). `deleted_at` is one of them under LWW like any
  other.

**No `owner_user_id` on the wire** (derived from `auth.uid()`; pull omits it
too). **No `extras` blob, no top-level `deleted` flag** — deletion is
`fields.deleted_at != null`.

### B.2.2 Error shape

```json
{ "error": { "code": "FK_VIOLATION", "message": "…" } }
```

| `code` | Cause | Client behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AUTH_REQUIRED` | No/expired JWT, RLS denies the row. | Refresh token; if it fails, keep dirty bits, surface "Sign in again." |
| `FK_VIOLATION` | Deferrable-FK check failed at COMMIT (A.5). Structural bug. | **Non-retriable.** Log; leave dirty bits; surface non-recoverable error. Fix lands by app update. |
| `INTERNAL` | Anything else (transport, 5xx, malformed payload). | Cycle returns with error; dirty bits stay set; next scheduler tick re-pushes. No backoff. |

**The server validates hierarchy (FKs) only** — no enum/range/length/format/
business-rule validation. Schema-level malformation is caught at PR time by the
drift gate (A.7).

> **Build note — DRIFT (doc-said-X → code-is-Y).** The former t2 §2.2 implied
> both RPCs return the `{"error":{"code","message"}}` JSON envelope uniformly.
> As-built they differ in transport while keeping the same wire *tokens*:
> - **`sync_pull`** returns the `{"error":{"code":…,"message":…}}` JSON body
>   directly (codes `AUTH_REQUIRED`, `INTERNAL`).
> - **`sync_push`** signals failure by `RAISE EXCEPTION` with `errcode = P0001`
>   and a message string carrying the literal token (`AUTH_REQUIRED: …`,
>   `FK_VIOLATION: …`, `INTERNAL: …`). PostgREST surfaces this as its standard
>   error JSON; the client pattern-matches the token prefix. FK-closure failures
>   are caught from `foreign_key_violation` at `SET CONSTRAINTS ALL IMMEDIATE`
>   and re-raised as `FK_VIOLATION:` so the token is stable regardless of which
>   FK tripped.
>
> Either way the client keys off the `AUTH_REQUIRED` / `FK_VIOLATION` /
> `INTERNAL` token. The push contract test asserts the raised-token behaviour;
> the pull contract test asserts the JSON-envelope behaviour.

## B.3 `sync_push`

### B.3.1 Request

```json
{ "entities": [ { "type": "...", "id": "...", "client_updated_at_ms": 0, "fields": { } } ] }
```

`entities` is an array of length `1..200` (the v2 batch cap). Larger streams are
split into sequential batches client-side.

> **Build note (verified).** The as-built RPC signature is
> `app_public.sync_push(entities jsonb default '[]'::jsonb)` — a **named**
> parameter, so PostgREST maps the `{"entities":[…]}` body key directly. It is
> `security invoker`, granted `execute` to `anon`, `authenticated`, and
> `service_role` (revoked from `public`). The `anon` grant lets PostgREST route
> an unauthenticated call into the body so the function's own `auth.uid() IS
> NULL` check (the first statement) emits `AUTH_REQUIRED` instead of a PostgREST
> 42501. The length check is enforced as `1..200`.

### B.3.2 Ordering inside the batch

Clients may send entities in any order; the full hierarchy must be present
(in the batch or already on the server — "closure"). The server runs one
transaction with `SET CONSTRAINTS ALL DEFERRED`; all FKs are checked at COMMIT
(forced early via `SET CONSTRAINTS ALL IMMEDIATE` so a `FK_VIOLATION` token can
be raised from inside the function). Any unsatisfied FK rolls back the whole
batch.

### B.3.3 What goes in `fields`

For each typed server column on the entity (A.2), put its current local value
under `fields.<wire_key>` (snake_case Postgres column name); nullable columns
get JSON null. Local-only sync columns (B.9) must not appear; any other client
column is drift, caught at PR time.

### B.3.4 Building the batch

The client must never push a child whose parent is neither in the batch nor on
the server (B.10 #6). It satisfies this by walking the nine tables in a fixed
**topological order** when collecting dirty rows.

#### B.3.4.1 Topological order

| Layer | Tables (any intra-layer order) | FKs to earlier layers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `gyms`, `exercise_definitions`, `muscle_groups` | none |
| 1 | `sessions`, `exercise_muscle_mappings`, `exercise_tag_definitions` | `sessions → gyms`; `exercise_muscle_mappings → exercise_definitions`, `→ muscle_groups`; `exercise_tag_definitions → exercise_definitions` |
| 2 | `session_exercises` | `→ sessions`, `→ exercise_definitions` |
| 3 | `exercise_sets`, `session_exercise_tags` | `exercise_sets → session_exercises`; `session_exercise_tags → session_exercises`, `→ exercise_tag_definitions` |

No table has a within-layer FK and none is self-referential, so any intra-layer
order is safe. This layering is hardcoded in
`apps/mobile/src/sync/topo-order.ts` and asserted against the live FK graph by
the drift checker (A.7.7).

> **Build note — corrected mapping (verified).** `exercise_tag_definitions` is
> in **Layer 1**, not Layer 0. The earlier draft placing it in Layer 0 was
> structurally impossible against the A.5.2 FK graph. `muscle_groups` is in
> **Layer 0** (no FK dependencies) and is the FK parent of
> `exercise_muscle_mappings` in Layer 1. The as-built `topo-order.ts` and the
> `sync_pull` SQL `case` both encode these placements.

#### B.3.4.2 `selectPushBatch(batchCap = 200) → Entity[]`

```
batch = []
for table in TOPO_ORDER:
  if len(batch) >= batchCap: break
  rows = SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE local_dirty = 1
         ORDER BY local_updated_at_ms ASC LIMIT (batchCap - len(batch))
  for row in rows: batch.append(serialize(row))
return batch
```

Called repeatedly by the cycle until it returns an empty array. Intra-table
`local_updated_at_ms ASC` ordering is FIFO quality-of-life; the FK guarantee
does not depend on it.

#### B.3.4.3 Why this gives no-orphan-child

For any dirty row `R`, every FK target is either (a) in the same batch from an
earlier layer (deferred FK resolves at COMMIT), (b) `local_dirty = 0` and
therefore already on the server (B.7.2 lifecycle), or (c) dirty but in a
not-yet-reached layer — in which case `R` is not in this batch either.

### B.3.5 Success response

```json
{ "ok": true, "server_received_at": "2026-05-23T10:14:32.871Z" }
```

A single ack; no per-row outcomes. The whole batch committed (each row either
LWW-applied or LWW-no-op — either way the server is at-or-newer than what the
client sent). `server_received_at` is the single transaction `now()` as an
ISO-8601 string; the client uses it for observability only. The client clears
`local_dirty` for each row subject to the B.7.3 concurrent-edit check.

> **Build note (verified).** The RPC captures one `now()` at entry, reuses it
> for `server_received_at` on every row, clamps each `client_updated_at_ms` to
> `least(incoming, now_ms + 5*60*1000)` (A.1 future-clock clamp), and upserts
> with `ON CONFLICT (owner_user_id, id) DO UPDATE … WHERE
> excluded.client_updated_at_ms > <table>.client_updated_at_ms` (A.1.1.1 LWW).
> Every column from `fields` — including `deleted_at` — is overwritten on the
> winning branch. `supabase/tests/sync-push-contract.sh` exercises LWW, the
> future-clock clamp, and Scenario-B undelete.

### B.3.6 Idempotency

A re-pushed row with the same `client_updated_at_ms` is a server-side no-op
under LWW; the ack still clears the dirty bit.

### B.3.7 Batch size

`batchCap = 200`. Fits well under the Supabase 1 MiB RPC request cap; the cycle
issues multiple sequential batches (B.6.3) when the dirty stream exceeds 200.

## B.4 `sync_pull`

Pull is symmetric to push: 200-row batches and topological-layer ordering. The
server drains layer-by-layer so a child page never lands before its parents are
on the client.

### B.4.1 Request

```json
{ "layer": 0, "cursor": null, "limit": 200 }
```

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `layer` | integer `0..3` | The topological layer being drained (mapping = B.3.4.1). |
| `cursor` | object or `null` | Opaque; round-trip the value the server emitted. `null` = snapshot/initial pull of this layer. Each layer has its own cursor. |
| `cursor.{server_received_at, owner_user_id, type, id}` | — | The four tiebreak axes from the last row of the previous page. |
| `limit` | integer `1..200` | Default 200. |

> **Build note (verified).** The as-built RPC signature is
> `app_public.sync_pull(jsonb)` — an **unnamed** parameter; PostgREST's
> single-jsonb fallback routes the raw body, and the body reads `payload->'layer'`,
> `payload->'cursor'`, `payload->'limit'`. It is `security invoker`, granted
> `execute` to `authenticated`, `service_role`, and `anon` (same `AUTH_REQUIRED`
> rationale as push). `layer` must be an integer `0..3`; `limit` an integer
> `1..200` defaulting to 200; `cursor` either null/absent or an object carrying
> all four keys with a `type` that is one of the nine entity types — otherwise
> `INTERNAL`.

### B.4.2 Response

```json
{
  "entities": [ { "type": "...", "id": "...", "client_updated_at_ms": 0, "fields": {} } ],
  "next_cursor": { "server_received_at": "...", "owner_user_id": "...", "type": "...", "id": "..." },
  "has_more": true
}
```

- `entities` — up to `limit` envelopes, all from tables in the requested
  `layer`, ordered by `(server_received_at, owner_user_id, type, id)` ascending.
- `next_cursor` — the cursor for the next pull of this same layer; always
  present (echoes input on an empty page; JSON `null` on an empty snapshot of a
  layer that holds no rows for this owner).
- `has_more` — `true` iff the layer has at least one more row strictly greater
  than `next_cursor`.

### B.4.3 Pagination — monotonicity and tiebreak

```sql
WHERE owner_user_id = auth.uid()
  AND type IN (<tables in :layer>)
  AND ( :cursor IS NULL
        OR (server_received_at, owner_user_id, type, id)
           > (:cursor.server_received_at, :cursor.owner_user_id, :cursor.type, :cursor.id) )
ORDER BY server_received_at ASC, owner_user_id ASC, type ASC, id ASC
LIMIT :limit
```

The row-value `>` ensures the next pull strictly advances past the last-emitted
row — never repeats, never skips within a stable snapshot. The cursor carries
`owner_user_id` for forward-compat with multi-owner pulls.

**Known limitation: concurrent-commit cursor race.** `server_received_at` is
set before COMMIT, while `now()` is transaction-start time, so two concurrent
pushes for the same owner can commit in inverted order vs their
`server_received_at`. A pull landing between the two commits can advance past
the later value and skip the earlier row. **Self-healing**: any subsequent edit
of the skipped row bumps `server_received_at` past the cursor. Acknowledged v2
limitation; future hardening could use `pg_xact_commit_timestamp(xmin)`.

> **Build note (verified).** The as-built query fetches `limit + 1` rows to

### B.4.4 Layer-by-layer drain (corrected mapping)

The cycle drains layers in topological order. By the time a layer-K page
applies, layers 0..K-1 are fully local, so every FK resolves immediately — no
`PRAGMA defer_foreign_keys` needed.

```
for layer in [0, 1, 2, 3]:
  while True:
    resp = sync_pull({ layer, cursor: cursors[layer], limit: 200 })
    applyPage(resp.entities)          // B.4.5
    cursors[layer] = resp.next_cursor // persist after each COMMIT
    if not resp.has_more: break
```

Layer→type mapping (as-built `sync_pull` `case`): 0 = `gyms`,
`exercise_definitions`, `muscle_groups`; 1 = `sessions`,
`exercise_muscle_mappings`, `exercise_tag_definitions`; 2 = `session_exercises`;
3 = `exercise_sets`, `session_exercise_tags`. (See the B.3.4.1 corrected-mapping
note.)
Per-layer cursors persist after every page COMMIT, so an aborted drain resumes
from where it stopped; the DB is FK-consistent at every commit boundary.

### B.4.5 Applying a pull page

Each page applies in one SQLite transaction. No deferred FKs are needed (layers
0..K-1 are fully local; no intra-layer FKs). Per-row LWW:

1. SELECT by `(type, id)`.
2. Row absent → INSERT all `fields`; set `local_dirty=0`,
   `local_updated_at_ms = incoming.client_updated_at_ms`.
3. Row present and `incoming.client_updated_at_ms > local.local_updated_at_ms` →
   UPDATE all `fields`; set `local_dirty=0`,
   `local_updated_at_ms = incoming.client_updated_at_ms`.
4. Otherwise → no-op (do not clear `local_dirty`; the local write is newer).

A per-row FK violation rolls back the page; the cursor does not advance; the
cycle terminates with a logged error (same posture as push `FK_VIOLATION`).

### B.4.6 Pull and concurrent local edits

A local mutation during a page apply flips `local_dirty=1` and bumps
`local_updated_at_ms`. The page-apply LWW (B.4.5) resolves correctly in both
orderings because the page transaction holds the SQLite connection for the whole
page.

### B.4.7 Cursor lifecycle

There are **four cursors**, one per layer, advancing independently; push affects
none of them. A cursor advances only after its layer's page COMMIT succeeds; a
rolled-back apply leaves all cursors unchanged. The four are stored in
`sync_runtime_state.pull_cursor` as a JSON object keyed by layer index
(`"0".."3"`); see B.9.2.

## B.5 First sign-in

On first successful sign-in (no `bootstrap_completed_at` in
`sync_runtime_state`), the runtime simply starts the scheduler. The first cycle
pulls everything (each layer's cursor = null) and pushes whatever is locally
dirty; LWW reconciles. No modal, no user choice.

`bootstrap_completed_at` is set the first time all four layers drain to
`has_more = false` in one cycle. It is a cold-start UX surface only; the
protocol does not branch on it.

**Auth precondition.** The local entity tables must hold rows owned by the
currently-signed-in user. Residue from a previous account would push to the new
account (RLS sets `owner_user_id = auth.uid()`) and break B.3.4.3's
"clean ⇒ server has the row" invariant. Wiping local entity tables on sign-out
(or `auth.uid()` change) is the auth layer's responsibility.

## B.6 The cycle interface

### B.6.1 What a cycle does

1. **Pull** — drain all four layers in order (B.4.4), applying each page (B.4.5)
   and advancing `cursors[layer]` after each.
2. **Push** — repeatedly `selectPushBatch` (B.3.4) + `sync_push` until the dirty
   stream is exhausted.
3. **Re-pull** — drain all four layers again; if a full round APPLIED no rows in
   either direction — every re-pull page empty or a pure no-op (re-delivering
   rows the device already holds at an equal-or-older timestamp), and the push
   leg sent nothing — the cycle converged; otherwise apply and continue.
4. **Repeat** until a full round is quiet.

Recommended order is PULL → PUSH → PULL; the scheduler only requires
convergence.

Quietness is keyed on **rows actually applied, not rows the server returned.** A
re-pull that hands back only rows already local (a benign echo — this device's
own just-pushed row, or a row a second device re-stamped to an equal-or-older
value) writes nothing and counts as quiet. Keying on `entities.length` would read
such a no-op as motion and spin a pointless extra round.

> **Build note — DRIFT (doc-said-X → code-is-Y).** An earlier draft of step 3
> tested `entities.length = 0` (rows RETURNED) for convergence. The as-built
> client (`apps/mobile/src/sync/cycle.ts`) keys the quiet-round test on rows
> CHANGED: `applyPullPage` returns the count it wrote and the loop converges when
> both pull legs wrote 0 and the push leg sent 0. The first-sign-in SEED decision
> still keys on rows RECEIVED (so a resumed bootstrap re-pulling already-local
> rows does not look empty and re-seed) — the two counts are intentionally
> distinct (`PullLegResult.received` vs `.changed`).

### B.6.2 What a cycle MUST guarantee

- **Drain to empty** (or aborted with forward progress in ≥1 batch).
- **Per-batch commits** — each `sync_push` is one transaction; each pull page
  commits before its cursor advances; an interruption leaves the DB consistent
  at the last committed batch.
- **Idempotency** — re-running from the same start state yields the same final
  state.
- **Surviving state** — only `local_dirty`, `local_updated_at_ms`, the four
  per-layer cursors, and the bootstrap flag survive between cycles (all in
  SQLite).
- **Duration** — the cycle runs PULL → PUSH → PULL until a full round is quiet
  (B.6.1); there is **no round cap and no wall-clock cycle deadline.** It is
  bounded by convergence itself plus each batch's own HTTP request timeout, so a
  sustained external write stream (a second device editing live) is followed to
  convergence rather than truncated, and a row re-edited in every push-in-flight
  window keeps re-pushing its latest value until the edits stop. Each cycle is
  retriable and resumable, so a long-running one need not finish in a single
  scheduler tick — the next tick resumes from the persisted cursors and dirty
  bits.

> **Build note — DRIFT (doc-said-X → code-is-Y).** An earlier draft promised a
> hard cycle duration ("abort cleanly within ~20s; the cycle checks elapsed time
> after each batch") and a round cap (`MAX_CYCLES_PER_CALL`). Neither is in the
> as-built v2: there is no per-batch elapsed-time check, and the former 5-round
> cap was removed because it silently rewrote any non-converging spin into a
> `'converged'` outcome — masking bugs and truncating a legitimate update stream
> — rather than surfacing it. The loop is now bounded purely by convergence and
> per-request HTTP timeouts. A hard cycle-level duration budget (abort-within-N
> with a per-batch elapsed check) remains possible future hardening; if added it
> must persist cursors/dirty bits on abort so the next tick resumes cleanly.

### B.6.3 Multi-batch push

When the dirty stream exceeds 200 rows, batch N's ack must be applied (dirty
bits cleared on committed rows) before batch N+1 is built, else N+1 re-sends.

### B.6.4 Why four cursors

Per-layer cursors give the FK-closure guarantee on apply (each layer-K page
applies after layers 0..K-1 are local). One cursor can't; per-table cursors give
nothing extra because the topological layers have no intra-layer FKs.

## B.7 Dirty-bit lifecycle

### B.7.1 The dirty bit

Every entity table has two local-only columns: `local_dirty integer not null
default 0` (1 iff the row needs pushing) and `local_updated_at_ms integer not
null default 0` (the row's client-monotonic timestamp, sent as
`client_updated_at_ms`). Neither crosses the wire. `local_dirty = 0` ⇒ the
server has the row (it only clears via push ack or pull apply).

### B.7.2 Setting and clearing

| Event | `local_dirty` | `local_updated_at_ms` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repo write (create/update/softDelete/cascade) | `1` | `nowMonotonic()` |
| Pull apply (incoming wins) | `0` | `incoming.client_updated_at_ms` |
| Pull apply (incoming loses) | unchanged | unchanged |
| Push ack (no concurrent edit) | `0` | unchanged |
| Push ack (concurrent edit detected) | unchanged (stays `1`) | unchanged |
| Push error | unchanged | unchanged |

Every repo write runs in a single Drizzle transaction that updates the row AND
sets the dirty bit; there is no "set dirty later" path.

### B.7.3 Push-in-flight race

At request time the cycle captures `Map<(type,id), sent_at_ms>` where
`sent_at_ms` is `local_updated_at_ms` at serialise time. On the success ack, per
row in one transaction: SELECT current `local_updated_at_ms`; if `==
sent_at_ms`, clear `local_dirty`; if `!=` (in practice `>`, the row was edited
again), leave it dirty for the next cycle.

## B.8 Clock-monotonicity guard

```
local_updated_at_ms = max(Date.now(), last_emitted_ms + 1)
```

A single helper in `apps/mobile/src/data/clock.ts` (`nowMonotonic()`) backs
every dirtying write. `last_emitted_ms` is persisted on the `sync_runtime_state`
singleton **synchronously, in the same SQLite transaction as the row write** —
fire-and-forget is unsafe (a crash between row commit and counter persist would
let the next launch emit a timestamp the server LWW-rejects). The counter is
device-global; any future account-switch wipe must leave it alone. A
module-scoped cache mirrors the persisted value for tight loops.

## B.9 Local-only sync-bookkeeping columns

### B.9.1 The two entity columns

All nine entity tables gain `local_dirty` (SQLite 0/1, default 0) and
`local_updated_at_ms` (epoch ms, default 0) — snake_case in SQLite,
`localDirty` / `localUpdatedAtMs` in Drizzle. Both are local-only: the push
serialiser omits them (B.3.3); the pull apply writes them (B.4.5).

### B.9.2 The pull cursors

Stored as a single JSON column `pull_cursor` (default `{}`) on
`sync_runtime_state`, keyed by layer index `"0".."3"`. Each entry is absent/null
(snapshot) or the opaque blob `{server_received_at, owner_user_id, type, id}`.
Each advances independently after that layer's page COMMIT (B.4.7).

### B.9.3 The monotonic-clock state

`last_emitted_ms integer default 0` on `sync_runtime_state` — the largest
`local_updated_at_ms` this device has emitted (B.8.3).

### B.9.4 Drift-checker registration

The two entity columns are registered globally in `sync-extras.json` under
`exemptions.local_only_columns`. `sync_runtime_state` is **not** in the drift
checker's scope (it has no server counterpart by design — the checker scans only
the nine entity tables), so `pull_cursor`, `last_emitted_ms`, and
`bootstrap_completed_at` need no registration.

### B.9.5 Push serialiser exclusion

The serialiser routes through one `entityToWire` function per entity that closes
over the typed server-column list (A.2); `local_only` columns are not in that
list, so they are never emitted.

## B.10 Client-enforced constraints (server does not enforce)

Per the no-server-validation rule (A.1), the server enforces only PK and FK
uniqueness. The remaining invariants are the client's responsibility — the
server has a **non-unique** index for each (A.2) and a duplicate landing on the
server is a client bug the protocol simply does not reject:

1. **Active `session_exercises`**: no two rows with `deleted_at IS NULL` sharing
   `(session_id, order_index)`. Reorder writes are serialised through one push
   batch per session.
2. **Active `exercise_sets`**: same for `(session_exercise_id, order_index)`.
3. **`exercise_muscle_mappings`**: no duplicate
   `(exercise_definition_id, muscle_group_id)` per owner.
4. **`exercise_tag_definitions`**: no duplicate active
   `(exercise_definition_id, normalized_name)` per owner.
5. **`session_exercise_tags`**: no duplicate
   `(session_exercise_id, exercise_tag_definition_id)` per owner.
6. **No orphan-child pushes** (A.5.3): the client must never push a child whose
   parent is neither in the same batch nor already on the server. B.3.4's
   topological batch builder guarantees this.

Row-level LWW on `client_updated_at_ms` (A.1.1.1) is implemented on both ends:
the server-side `sync_push` UPSERT predicate (B.3.5) and the client-side pull
apply (B.4.5).

## B.11 Out of scope

- Server-side retention/GC of `deleted_at IS NOT NULL` rows (stored as regular
  rows in v2).
- Group/sharing domain operations (M18 group catalogues, private-to-group mappings, exercise creation requests, and shared session projections operate as online backend queries/RPCs outside the Sync v2 9-table mirror engine).
- Web client and MCP read paths against the typed schema (they consume Part A's
  schema directly with no Part B protocol involvement).

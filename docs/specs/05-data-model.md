# Data Model (Authoritative)

> **Owns:** the canonical data model, entity boundaries, sync scope, ownership invariants. **Not here:** the server wire contract → `tech/sync-v2-server-contract.md`. **Load when:** schema, migration, or sync-scope work.

## Purpose

Define the canonical data model boundaries for local mobile storage, backend persistence, ownership, and sync scope.

This document is project-level source of truth for what data exists and how it is expected to move.

## Relationship to other specs

- Architecture/runtime behavior lives in `docs/specs/03-technical-architecture.md`.
- Testing requirements live in `docs/specs/06-testing-strategy.md`.
- The verified-accurate, normative Sync v2 reference (server schema, the
  push/pull RPC protocol, LWW/undelete semantics, drift control) is
  `docs/specs/tech/sync-v2-server-contract.md`. This document owns the
  data-model boundaries and ownership invariants; it defers deep wire/RPC detail
  to that contract by anchor (`§A.x` server schema, `§B.x` push/pull protocol).
- Milestone/task docs may add detail but must not override this document.

## Current model layers

1. Mobile local data layer (`SQLite` via Drizzle)
- primary runtime store for app behavior.
- holds user-owned domain data; the seeded taxonomies (`exercise_definitions`,
  `muscle_groups`) are system-seeded starter catalogs that then sync as ordinary
  per-user entities, not static read-only data.
- production bootstrap must enable SQLite `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` for the app
  connection at connection-open (the moment the database handle is opened, before
  any migrations or seeding run) so enforcement is active for both migrations and
  seed inserts — and must run `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` after migrations/seeds so
  local graph violations are diagnosed at startup instead of surfacing only
  during backend sync.

2. Backend auth/profile layer (`Supabase Auth` + `app_public.user_profiles`)
- auth identity and account profile management.
- not the same as generic sync-domain backup.

3. Backend sync mirror layer (Sync v2)
- one typed `app_public.<entity>` table per client entity table, written by the
  `sync_push` RPC and read by the `sync_pull` RPC under per-row last-write-wins.
- there is no projection function and no event log: the data is the event.

## Local schema inventory (current)

### User-owned domain data (sync/backups expected)

- `gyms` (user-owned personal gym rows; nullable private coordinate metadata is in sync scope)
- `sessions`
- `session_exercises`
- `exercise_sets` (actual entered `weight_value` / `reps_value` / `set_type`, plus optional planned target fields `planned_weight_value` / `planned_reps_value` / `planned_set_type` and `performance_status` for explicit planned/unperformed execution state; legacy `skipped` values remain readable)
- `exercise_definitions`
  - `load_input_mode` is required metadata with values `total_load` and
    `per_side_load`. It describes whether the entered scalar is a shared load
    or already one-side load; it is not inferred from equipment names.
- `exercise_muscle_mappings`
- `exercise_tag_definitions`
- `session_exercise_tags`
- `muscle_groups` (per-user taxonomy; system-seeded as a starter catalog, then
  synced like any other entity — modeled on `exercise_definitions`)

### Test/runtime-only data (not user backup scope)

- `smoke_records`
- `sync_runtime_state` (singleton row; see *Local sync bookkeeping* below)
- `sync_quarantine` — local-only push-side quarantine bookkeeping for dirty rows
  whose required FK parents are missing locally. Never synced and FK-free.

### Local sync bookkeeping (Sync v2)

v2 keeps no separate outbox/delivery tables. Per-row sync state is two local-only
columns on each of the nine user-owned entity tables:
`local_dirty` (1 iff the row needs pushing) and `local_updated_at_ms` (the
monotonic client timestamp, sent as `client_updated_at_ms`). Neither crosses the
wire. Device-global sync state lives on the `sync_runtime_state` singleton row:
`pull_cursor` (per-layer JSON cursor map), `last_emitted_ms` (the monotonic-clock
high-water mark), and `bootstrap_completed_at`. Deep detail:
`docs/specs/tech/sync-v2-server-contract.md` §B.9.

`sync_quarantine` stores one row per quarantined dirty entity, keyed by
`(entity_type, entity_id)` with `error_code`, diagnostic FK context
(`parent_type`, `parent_id_field`, `parent_id`), `first_seen_at_ms`,
`last_seen_at_ms`, and `occurrence_count`. Push selection excludes quarantined
rows so one local orphan cannot wedge the backlog.

## Backend schema inventory (current)

### Auth/profile

- `auth.users` (identity)
- `app_public.user_profiles` (username profile data, `1:1` with `auth.users(id)`)

### Sync-domain mirror tables (Sync v2)

One typed `app_public.<entity>` table per client entity table. Each is a direct
mirror of its client Drizzle table (no projection layer): composite primary key
`(owner_user_id, id)`, all nine composite cross-entity FKs declared
`DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED`, and the universal sync columns
`client_updated_at_ms` (the LWW key), `server_received_at` (the pull-cursor axis),
and a nullable `deleted_at` tombstone. Per-column mapping is in
`docs/specs/tech/sync-v2-server-contract.md` §A.2.

- `app_public.gyms` (carries the four nullable private coordinate columns)
- `app_public.sessions`
- `app_public.session_exercises`
- `app_public.exercise_sets` (actual logged set values plus optional planned target fields and `performance_status`)
- `app_public.exercise_definitions`
- `app_public.exercise_muscle_mappings`
- `app_public.exercise_tag_definitions`
- `app_public.session_exercise_tags`
- `app_public.muscle_groups` (per-user taxonomy mirror; FK parent of
  `exercise_muscle_mappings.muscle_group_id`)

There are no backend ingest-metadata tables: with no event log there is nothing
to deduplicate per device, so idempotency falls out of per-row LWW.

### Diagnostics tables (M14 baseline)

- `public.app_logs`
  - minimal app diagnostics for auth/sync failure investigation.
  - authenticated clients may insert only.
  - client-side `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` are intentionally unavailable.
  - sync impact decision: `out of sync scope`; logs are operational diagnostics, not user-domain backup/restore data.

### Agent access metadata (M21)

- `public.agent_access_audit`
  - minimal metadata-only audit for authenticated BoGa3 agent API requests;
  - stores owner ID, OAuth client ID, tool/route name, timestamp, status,
    request ID, and duration only;
  - normal app sessions may read only their own rows; OAuth tokens cannot read
    the table directly; service-side insert only;
  - sync impact decision: `out of sync scope` because access audit is
    operational/security metadata, not user training backup data.
- `app_public.user_profiles.training_unit` and `time_zone`
  - training-relevant API preferences in the auth/profile layer;
  - sync impact decision: `out of sync scope` because `user_profiles` is
    explicitly outside the nine-table Sync v2 mirror.

### Group exercise catalogue, mapping, and sharing domain (M18)

- Private exercise definitions (`app_public.exercise_definitions`) remain strictly user-private entities. They are never exposed to or directly queried by other members of a group.
- Group domain entities (`groups`, `group_memberships`, `group_exercise_catalogue`, `group_exercise_requests`) and user mappings (`user_group_exercise_mappings`) are online backend domain structures.
- Private-to-group exercise mappings are owned by the user (`user_id = auth.uid()`). A user mapping link does not grant other group members read access to the user's private `exercise_definitions` table.
- Shared session projections represent static snapshot projections created at the time of sharing. They use group exercise identifiers/names and do not expose private exercise metadata. Post-share edits to private source sessions do not mutate shared group projections.
- Sync impact decision: `out of sync scope` for the Sync v2 9-table user-private LWW engine. Group operations, catalogues, mappings, and shared session projections are online backend API operations, isolated from the 9-table LWW sync protocol.

## Ownership and identity invariants

1. User-owned backend rows are auth-scoped and backend-enforced (`RLS`/constraints).
2. Mobile clients never use `service_role` credentials.
3. Sync transport must be idempotent for repeated delivery attempts. Under v2 this
   follows from per-row last-write-wins: re-pushing a row with the same
   `client_updated_at_ms` is a server no-op (the ack still clears the dirty bit).
4. Concurrent multi-device writes are resolved by per-row last-write-wins keyed on
   `client_updated_at_ms`; there is no central ordering authority, no per-device
   sequence, and no event log. Acknowledged trade-off: a stale-clock write can lose
   to a newer stored value (including the undelete-loses case in
   `docs/specs/tech/sync-v2-server-contract.md` §A.1.1.2 Scenario A).
5. Diagnostic log rows are write-only from authenticated clients and are manually inspected through backend operator tooling.
6. All nine sync-domain mirror tables use composite primary key
   `(owner_user_id, id)` — **owner-first**. The column order is load-bearing: the
   canonical pull query (`where owner_user_id = … order by server_received_at`)
   leads with the PK column, and the per-layer pull cursor depends on it (contract
   §A.1, §B.4.3). Every user owns their own `id` keyspace, so two users may
   legitimately hold rows with the same `id` (for example, the same seeded
   `exercise_definitions.id`) without conflict. Cross-owner row-level conflicts are
   not possible by construction, and the backend has no cross-owner rejection path.
   Each user's seed catalog is per-user data from day one; no shared/global catalog
   of these entities exists on the backend.
7. Gym coordinate metadata is private, user-owned data stored on `gyms`, not a shared/public location entity.

## Local integrity contract

1. Local SQLite foreign-key enforcement is required for the production mobile
   database connection. The app enables it explicitly via
   `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` at **connection-open** — immediately after the
   database handle is opened, before migrations and seeding run — so enforcement
   is active for both. expo-sqlite does not enforce FKs by default, so this pragma
   is what makes the declared local FK constraints active. After migrations and
   seeds complete, bootstrap runs `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` to surface any local
   graph violations at startup. Repository and sync write paths assume enforcement
   is on, so invalid child rows fail at the local write or pull-apply boundary.
2. **Client FKs only reference synced parents.** Every declared local FK points
   at a table that is itself a per-user synced entity, so a wiped/reinstalled
   client re-pulls the parent (its earlier topological layer) before the child
   and the FK holds under enforcement. There is no local FK into a static or
   client-only table that could brick on a cross-version skew. (This is why
   `muscle_groups` — the FK parent of `exercise_muscle_mappings.muscle_group_id`
   — is a synced entity rather than a version-bundled taxonomy.)
3. Bootstrap FK pragma/integrity failures are logged through `public.app_logs`
   diagnostics with sanitized context and then rethrown; logging failure must
   not mask the original SQLite failure.
4. Tests that assert FK-sensitive data or sync behavior must enable FK
   enforcement in their SQLite fixture instead of relying on SQLite's default
   per-connection FK-off mode.

## Sync v2 data-model contract

Deep wire/RPC detail lives in `docs/specs/tech/sync-v2-server-contract.md`; this
section states only the data-model-level invariants.

1. The nine user-owned entity tables are mirrored 1:1 on the backend as typed
   `app_public.<entity>` tables. The client marks a mutated row dirty
   (`local_dirty = 1`, `local_updated_at_ms = nowMonotonic()`) and pushes the full
   typed row — not a granular event. There is no outbox, no projection, no event
   log: the data is the event.
2. Conflict resolution is per-row last-write-wins keyed on `client_updated_at_ms`,
   resolved identically on both ends (the `sync_push` upsert predicate and the
   client pull-apply). Row identity is the composite PK `(owner_user_id, id)`;
   idempotency follows from LWW (contract §A.1.1, §B.10).
3. The backend stores each pushed row directly under LWW upsert. Deletion is
   `deleted_at` going non-null; undelete is the same row with `deleted_at` returning
   to null under the same LWW rule. There is no separate `deleted` flag and no
   special delete/undelete path (contract §A.1.1).
4. Restore/bootstrap is a full `sync_pull` drain across all four topological layers
   (first sign-in or wiped-client reinstall). It must be coherent across all
   user-owned entities listed in this document, with FK integrity preserved at every
   layer boundary (parents drain before children).
5. `exercise_sets` metadata includes optional `set_type` (`warm_up | rir_0 | rir_1 | rir_2 | null`) and remains nullable for legacy/unspecified sets. `warm_up` is an effort/display classification, not a general stats exclusion flag: valid warm-up sets count toward volume, estimated 1RM, highest/top weight, heatmaps, and other strength/volume metrics, but are not working sets. A working set is a valid confirmed set whose normalized `set_type` is `rir_0`, `rir_1`, or `rir_2`; warm-up, null/unclassified, invalid, and unconfirmed rows are not working sets.
6. Planned workout execution targets and explicit performance state are `in sync scope`: `exercise_sets.planned_weight_value`, `planned_reps_value`, `planned_set_type`, and `performance_status` are carried in the existing push/pull wire envelope. `performance_status` is nullable unconstrained text; new writes use `planned` and `unperformed`, while a valid actual row with `null` is the confirmed/performed representation. The historical `skipped` value remains accepted for backward compatibility but hydrates as an untouched `planned` row and is never written by current recorder actions. This adds no column, server migration, or wire-envelope field.
   - New empty and copied/defaulted active rows use `unperformed`, even when copied values are already valid. For upgrade compatibility, a pre-existing valid row with legacy `null` remains confirmed; a blank or partial legacy draft row with `null` hydrates as `unperformed` so later entry cannot silently confirm it.
   - Active and completed-edit autosave preserve planned and unperformed rows losslessly. Legacy skipped rows normalize to planned on hydration. Final active-session submit and completed-edit save write completed workout history from valid confirmed actual rows only. Entered valid unconfirmed rows require a specific discard confirmation; they are never promoted or discarded implicitly.
   - Any reader with performed/completed semantics filters to valid actual values plus confirmed status. This includes recorder counts and live comparisons, session lists and completed detail, exercise catalog/history/records and suggested plans, muscle/exercise analytics and stats, and the agent coaching history API. Planned, legacy-skipped, unperformed, blank, partial, invalid, deleted, and tombstoned rows do not contribute.
7. Active `exercise_sets` rows are lossless draft data: fully blank and partial
   rows retain their IDs and order through save, hydration, and navigation.
   When `reps_value` is a positive integer, blank `weight_value` is canonicalized
   to `"0"` at input-commit, persistence, or completion boundaries and supplies
   valid actual values for a zero-load set; it becomes performed only after the
   row is explicitly confirmed. Blank or invalid reps remain incomplete and require
   explicit cleanup confirmation at completion. This is value normalization
   within the existing string column and Sync v2 field; it introduces no schema
   migration or wire-envelope change.
8. `gyms` may include nullable coordinate metadata: `latitude`, `longitude`, `coordinate_accuracy_m`, and `coordinates_updated_at`. The sync impact decision is `in sync scope`; all four columns are carried verbatim by the `gyms` push/pull wire envelope, the first-full-pull bootstrap, and reinstall restore parity.
9. Gym coordinate fields are either all null or all non-null. Valid ranges are latitude `-90..90`, longitude `-180..180`, accuracy `>= 0`, and non-negative `coordinates_updated_at` epoch milliseconds. Clearing saved coordinates sets all four coordinate fields to null. These ranges are client-enforced — the server runs no validation (contract §A.1).
10. Muscle volume is recomputed per side from current exercise metadata. Each
   valid set starts with entered volume (`weight × reps`), halves that base for
   `total_load`, preserves it for `per_side_load`, then multiplies by the
   mapping role factor: `1` for primary and `0.5` for secondary. Persisted
   `exercise_muscle_mappings.weight` does not alter this calculation; null-role
   and stabilizer mappings do not contribute. One-arm/one-leg rows imply both
   sides were performed in v1. Exercise history, records, highest weight, and
   estimated 1RM remain based on the entered scalar and do not use per-side
   normalization or muscle-role factors.

### Wire envelope (Sync v2)

Push request and pull response share **one** envelope shape per row:

```json
{ "type": "<entity>", "id": "...", "client_updated_at_ms": 0, "fields": { } }
```

`fields` carries every typed column for the entity (including `deleted_at`, which
is a normal LWW column); `owner_user_id` never crosses the wire (the RPCs are
`security invoker`, so it is derived from `auth.uid()` via RLS). The envelope
carries no event-log metadata — no device, sequence, or event ids — because there
is no event log. Field-by-field detail: contract §B.2.

### Entity coverage (Sync v2)

There are no per-entity event types. Every one of the nine entities moves through
the same LWW upsert path. A delete is a row whose `deleted_at` is non-null; an
undelete is that same row with `deleted_at` back to null. A reorder or complete is
an ordinary field change (`order_index` / `status`); an attach is the join-table
row (`exercise_muscle_mappings` / `session_exercise_tags`) being inserted or
undeleted, and a detach is that same row soft-deleted via `deleted_at`.

### Push/pull contract (Sync v2)

- `sync_push` uploads a batch of `1..200` dirty rows and upserts them under LWW in
  **one transaction**, returning a single `{ "ok": true, "server_received_at": … }`
  ack — no per-row outcomes, no partial-batch commit. The whole batch either
  commits or rolls back (deferrable FKs are checked at COMMIT). Failures surface as
  exactly one of `AUTH_REQUIRED`, `FK_VIOLATION`, or `INTERNAL` (contract §B.2.2,
  §B.3).
- `sync_pull` downloads rows newer than a per-layer cursor, draining the four
  topological layers in order so a child page never lands before its parents
  (contract §B.4). The four per-layer cursors persist in
  `sync_runtime_state.pull_cursor`.

## Maintenance rule (mandatory)

Update this file in the same task/session when any of the following change:

- local schema entities or ownership classification,
- backend schema entities participating in user backup/sync,
- sync data-scope boundaries,
- identity/ownership invariants that affect data integrity.

Sync impact gate (mandatory for every data-model change):

- EVERY time a data model entity/relationship/ownership boundary is added or changed, sync impact MUST be explicitly addressed in the same task/session.
- The task must record one explicit decision:
  - `in sync scope` (with contract/mapping + implementation/test updates), or
  - `out of sync scope` (with explicit rationale and guardrails).
- Do not leave new/changed data-model elements with undefined sync behavior.

## Client schema drift rule (Sync v2)

Modifying any file under `apps/mobile/src/data/schema/` for the nine user-owned
entities (`gyms`, `sessions`, `session_exercises`, `exercise_sets`,
`exercise_definitions`, `exercise_muscle_mappings`, `exercise_tag_definitions`,
`session_exercise_tags`, `muscle_groups`) to add a domain column requires a
paired server migration under `supabase/migrations/` that adds the matching
`app_public.<entity>` column with a compatible Postgres type, **and the server
migration must be deployed to production before the client change ships**.

Why "server first": a client that depends on a typed server column not yet
deployed will fail to round-trip that column; the server has nowhere typed to
store it. Server-ahead-of-client is always safe (the column sits unwritten
until the client catches up).

The drift checker (`apps/mobile/scripts/check-sync-schema-drift.ts`, invoked via
`npm run check:sync-drift` and gated by `./scripts/quality-slow.sh backend`)
enforces the rule by booting a local Postgres, applying every migration, and
introspecting the live schema. PRs failing the gate cannot merge. The checker
also asserts the hardcoded topological table order in
`apps/mobile/src/sync/topo-order.ts` against the live FK graph (see
`docs/specs/tech/sync-v2-server-contract.md` §A.7.7) — adding a new entity table
or FK without updating that list also fails the gate.

This rule does NOT apply to: `smoke_records`, `sync_runtime_state`, or
`sync_quarantine` (test/runtime scaffolding and local sync bookkeeping) — these
have no server counterpart and are out of the checker's scope, which introspects
only the nine `app_public.<entity>` mirror tables. Nor does it apply to the two
local-only sync-bookkeeping columns (`local_dirty`, `local_updated_at_ms`) on
each entity table: those are listed under `exemptions.local_only_columns` in
`sync-extras.json`. (`muscle_groups` is no longer exempt — it is one of the nine
synced entities, and `exercise_muscle_mappings.muscleGroupId` is a typed,
FK-checked column like any other.)

If your client change adds a value to an existing column (e.g., a new enum literal),
the rule does not apply because the column already exists on both sides; the client
is free to validate the enum and the server stores arbitrary text per the v2
no-server-validation policy in `docs/specs/tech/sync-v2-server-contract.md` §A.1.

# Supabase Local Runtime (M5 Baseline)

This folder is the backend root for M5 (`Supabase` local-first development and testing).

## Purpose (T-20260220-08)

- Provide a reproducible local backend runtime scaffold.
- Prove migration + reset/seed flow from a clean local state.
- Expose a health endpoint for explicit API-surface smoke checks.
- Establish backend-local smoke test and fixture conventions for follow-on M5 tasks.

## Prerequisites

- Docker-compatible container runtime (Docker Desktop verified in this repo session).
- On macOS with Colima, see `RUNBOOK.md` for the local Supabase preflight.
- `npx`/`npm` available (repo scripts run `npx supabase@<pin>`; the pin is `BOGA_SUPABASE_CLI_DEFAULT_VERSION` in `scripts/worktree-lib.sh`).
- Optional: install Supabase CLI globally (`supabase`) if preferred, but repo scripts do not require it.

## Local environment configuration strategy

- Run `./scripts/worktree-setup.sh` from the repo root before local runtime use.
- Checked-in Supabase config is `supabase/config.toml.template`.
- Generated per-worktree config is `supabase/config.toml` and is gitignored.
- Local script overrides: `supabase/.env.local`
  - setup links this to `~/.config/boga/supabase/cli.env`
  - optional script-level overrides such as `SUPABASE_CLI_VERSION` (versions
    below `BOGA_SUPABASE_CLI_MIN_VERSION` are rejected; see `RUNBOOK.md`)
- Local function env vars: `supabase/functions/.env.local`
  - setup links this to `~/.config/boga/edge-functions/env.shared`
  - used by `supabase functions serve --env-file ...`
- Hosted placeholders (no secrets committed): `supabase/.env.hosted`
  - setup links this to `~/.config/boga/supabase/env.hosted`
  - detailed hosted env/deployment command path is owned by `T-20260220-09`

## One-command local startup path

For an iOS Simulator, run from repo root:

```bash
./supabase/scripts/local-runtime-up.sh
```

What it does:

1. Starts the Supabase local stack (`supabase start` via pinned `npx`).
2. Opportunistically sweeps completed worktree Supabase infra before startup.
3. Starts the local Edge Runtime for every function under
   `supabase/functions/**` (including `health` and `agent-api`).
4. Waits until `GET /functions/v1/health` responds. The shared baseline
   preflight also refreshes this worktree's Edge Runtime when a previously
   running stack has not yet registered a newly checked-out `agent-api`.

For a physical device pointed at local Supabase over the Mac LAN IP:

```bash
./scripts/dev/use-local-mobile-lan-env.sh   # or: ./boga env lan
```

For a physical device pointed at hosted Supabase:

```bash
./scripts/dev/use-hosted-mobile-env.sh   # or: ./boga env hosted
```

Stop the local runtime:

```bash
./supabase/scripts/local-runtime-down.sh
```

Sweep completed/orphaned worktree Supabase infra:

```bash
./scripts/worktree-sweep.sh
```

## Deterministic local reset/seed path

Run from repo root:

```bash
./supabase/scripts/reset-local.sh
```

This wraps `supabase db reset --local --yes` and applies:

- `supabase/migrations/*` (baseline schema/bootstrap)
- `supabase/seed.sql` (deterministic test fixtures)

## Local smoke checks

Health endpoint:

```bash
./supabase/scripts/smoke-health.sh
```

Seed fixture baseline (via local Supabase REST API):

```bash
./supabase/scripts/smoke-seed.sh
```

Combined fast backend-local check (current baseline for this task):

```bash
./boga test backend-fast
```

Shared runtime baseline preflight for real-instance contract/E2E flows:

```bash
./supabase/scripts/ensure-local-runtime-baseline.sh
```

Behavior:

1. If local Supabase is not running, it starts the stack, resets/seeds DB, and provisions deterministic auth fixtures.
2. If local Supabase is already running, it reuses that instance as-is (no reset), verifies baseline seed fixtures, and reprovisions auth fixtures idempotently.
3. Bootstrap/reset path is lock-protected so concurrent callers on one machine do not race startup.

Current coverage:

- local stack bring-up
- migrations + reset + seed
- DB lint (`supabase db lint --fail-on error`)
- Edge health endpoint smoke
- deterministic fixture seed smoke

## M5 auth/authz baseline (implemented in `T-20260220-10`)

Current auth posture for backend/API work:

- `Supabase Auth` + Postgres `RLS`
- `email + password` sign-in for provisioned users
- public self-signup disabled (`[auth].enable_signup = false`)
- email provider kept enabled for password logins (`[auth.email].enable_signup = true`)
- user-owned sync tables live in `app_public` and are protected by `RLS`
- `gyms`, `sessions`, `session_exercises`, and `exercise_sets` are user-private in MVP

### Key boundaries (must keep)

- `anon` key is client-safe and used with user JWTs for normal app data access.
- `service_role` is server/admin only (provisioning, maintenance, tightly scoped backend tasks).
- Never expose `service_role` to mobile/client code.

## Auth provisioning (controlled users, no self-signup)

Provision deterministic local auth fixtures (`user_a`, `user_b`) after local reset:

```bash
./supabase/scripts/auth-provision-local-fixtures.sh
```

Provision the human **development** sign-in accounts (`a@dev.local`, `b@dev.local`, `history@dev.local`) — kept
separate from the test fixtures so manual dev never collides with the suites that
reset/wipe `user_a`/`user_b`:

```bash
./supabase/scripts/auth-provision-dev-accounts.sh
```

These dev accounts are plain auth users (no `--fixture-key`, not in
`public.dev_fixture_principals`); credentials live in
`supabase/scripts/dev-account-constants.sh`. `history@dev.local` is the rich
GymBook-history account seeded by `boga db dev`. See `RUNBOOK.md` → "Log into a
development database" for the full account inventory and sign-in flow.

Provision or update one user (local, or any environment where `API_URL` + `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` or `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are exported):

```bash
./supabase/scripts/auth-provision-user.sh \
  --email user@example.test \
  --password 'StrongPassword!234'
```

Notes:

- Uses the Supabase Auth Admin API (service-role only).
- Hosted provisioning requires the legacy JWT `service_role` key. Do not use a publishable key (`sb_publishable_...`) or secret key (`sb_secret_...`) for this script.
- Local fixture provisioning also syncs `public.dev_fixture_principals` aliases (`user_a`, `user_b`) to the real local auth user UUIDs for deterministic ownership tests.

## Auth/authz contract tests (local Supabase)

Run the M5 auth/authz baseline suite:

```bash
./boga test auth-authz
```

The lane runs through `supabase/scripts/run-suite.sh`, which enforces the shared runtime baseline first (`ensure-local-runtime-baseline.sh`) and then runs the contract suite.

Coverage includes:

- password auth success/failure
- self-signup disabled path
- unauthenticated access denial on protected tables
- cross-user read/update denial (`RLS`)
- owner spoofing denial
- cross-user parent/child ownership mismatch rejection (DB constraint path)

## M5 sync API contract baseline (implemented in `T-20260220-11`)

Chosen API surface for the M5 sync baseline:

- `PostgREST` table routes on `app_public` (`gyms`, `sessions`, `session_exercises`, `exercise_sets`)
- auth via `anon` key + user JWT
- authorization via table `RLS` + FK/check constraints

Sync v2 server contract (schema + push/pull RPC wire protocol):

- `docs/specs/tech/sync-v2-server-contract.md`

Local sync contract suites (sync v2):

```bash
# run all backend slow suites together:
./boga test backend
# or individually:
./boga test sync-v2-schema
./boga test sync-push-contract
./boga test sync-pull-contract
./boga test sync-v2-e2e
```

These enforce the shared runtime baseline first (`ensure-local-runtime-baseline.sh`) and then run the sync-v2 contract suites.

Coverage includes success read/write flows, validation failures, unauthenticated denial, and cross-user denial across all sync-domain entities, including session metadata parity fields (`session_exercises.exercise_definition_id`, `exercise_sets.set_type`).

Parallel-run note:

- each initialized BOGA worktree gets readable Supabase `project_id`, slot-derived ports, containers, and database volume.
- the sync/auth contract suites use per-run unique record IDs, so repeated runs in one slot do not collide.
- tests require the deterministic fixture baseline to exist but do not require empty app tables.
- run `./scripts/worktree-doctor.sh` when a backend suite appears to hit another worktree's local runtime.

## M21 read-only agent API and OAuth boundary

The Virtual Coach read path is:

```text
MCP client -> services/boga-mcp -> functions/v1/agent-api -> app_public
```

`agent-api` is the only BoGa data service available to OAuth agent tokens. On
every request it validates the bearer token live with Supabase Auth, requires
the validated JWT to contain an OAuth `client_id`, verifies that the matching
user grant is still active, derives the owner only from the validated subject,
and then performs an explicit owner-filtered service-role read. Its public
routes are:

- `GET /functions/v1/agent-api/v1/agent/session`
- `GET /functions/v1/agent-api/v1/agent/profile`
- `GET /functions/v1/agent-api/v1/agent/exercises`
- `GET /functions/v1/agent-api/v1/agent/exercises/:id/context`
- `GET /functions/v1/agent-api/v1/agent/workouts/recent`

The function is configured with `verify_jwt = false` because it must perform
live Auth and grant validation itself and return one stable API envelope.
Disabling the gateway check does not make a route public: the function rejects
missing, invalid, expired, normal-app, and revoked credentials before creating
its service-role data client.

The M21 migration adds restrictive RLS policies requiring `client_id IS NULL`
for direct domain/profile/log access. An OAuth token therefore cannot use
PostgREST, `sync_push`, app profile/log paths, or any application write route.
The service role is confined to `agent-api`; it must never be injected into
`services/boga-mcp` or `apps/agent-auth-web`.

Run the real local authorization/API contract:

```bash
./boga test agent-api
```

The lane completes dynamic client registration and authorization code + PKCE
consent, then proves owner isolation, bounded parameters, canonical
calculations, invalid/expired/revoked rejection, direct RLS denial, sync-write
denial, and metadata-only audit rows. Run the full protocol-to-data smoke with:

```bash
./boga test mcp-smoke
```

Hosted enablement:

1. Link the target project and apply every migration:
   `bash -lc 'source supabase/scripts/_common.sh && run_supabase db push --linked --include-all'`.
2. From the repository root deploy the function:
   `bash -lc 'source supabase/scripts/_common.sh && run_supabase functions deploy agent-api --no-verify-jwt'`.
3. Keep `app_public` in the hosted exposed-schema list. Although agent OAuth
   tokens have no direct access, the normal mobile app still uses this schema.
4. Enable the Supabase OAuth server, configure `/oauth/consent`, choose the
   dynamic-registration posture, and use asymmetric signing keys.
5. Deploy the consent app and MCP service using their colocated READMEs.
6. Run hosted discovery, consent, tool, cross-owner, revocation, and audit
   checks. Do not use a local result as hosted proof.

Supabase-hosted Edge Functions receive the project service role at runtime.
Do not copy that value into repository files, the consent web build, or the MCP
host. Restrict function logs from capturing `Authorization`, URL query state,
or response payloads.

## Accessing `app_public` via REST (local/manual testing)

`app_public` is exposed in the local API config. For direct `PostgREST` calls, send schema profile headers:

- `Accept-Profile: app_public`
- `Content-Profile: app_public` (writes)

## Hosted sync bootstrap and reset

Canonical hosted bootstrap is the checked-in migration chain (`supabase/migrations/*.sql`) applied via the Supabase CLI. The previous hand-curated bootstrap blob (`hosted-bootstrap-sync.sql`) was removed during the sync redesign clean-slate — it had drifted from the live schema and is not part of the supported path.

Standard hosted enablement on a fresh project:

1. `supabase link --project-ref <ref>` (one-time).
2. `supabase db push --linked --include-all` to apply every checked-in migration.
3. Keep `app_public` listed in Dashboard **Project Settings -> API -> Data API Settings -> Exposed schemas**.

Reset hosted to a known-good clean slate (when there is no data worth preserving): use Dashboard **Database -> Reset**, or `supabase db reset --linked --yes`. Both reapply `supabase/migrations/*.sql` in order against a fresh DB. See `RUNBOOK.md` for the operator-facing checklist.

Historical note: `supabase/hosted-hotfix-relax-session-exercise-definition-fk.sql` was a one-off hotfix retained for archival. The FK it relaxed no longer exists after the sync redesign, so the file is inert against the current schema.

For local parity before and after a hosted reset, run `./supabase/scripts/reset-local.sh`, `./supabase/scripts/ensure-local-runtime-baseline.sh`, `./scripts/quality-fast.sh backend`, and `./scripts/quality-slow.sh backend`. On WSL, verify Docker Desktop integration from this distribution first with `docker info`.

(An earlier hosted migration-history repair predates the sync redesign; its task card has been archived out.)

## Fixture baseline (deterministic)

`supabase/seed.sql` seeds `public.dev_fixture_principals` with named fixtures used by follow-on ownership/authz tests:

- `anonymous`
- `user_a`
- `user_b`
- `service_role_helper` (optional helper fixture)

These are dev fixtures only and do **not** lock the final auth linkage design for M5 auth/sync tasks.

## Health endpoint note

The `health` Edge Function is a local runtime smoke surface only. It exists to validate:

- local stack reachability
- local Edge Function serving path
- deterministic endpoint smoke checks

It does **not** lock the final sync API surface choice for `T-20260220-11` (`Edge Functions` vs `PostgREST/RPC` mix).

## Follow-on testing layers (documented now, implemented incrementally)

- `DB` tests: `pgTAP` (`supabase test db`) for policies/functions/constraints
- `Edge` unit tests: add when Edge logic beyond simple health exists
- `Supabase-local` integration/contract tests: required for auth/RLS/API tasks
- hosted smoke validation: owned by `T-20260220-09` (manual by default until CI exists)
- cross-stack `E2E`: strategy only in M5; repo-root `e2e/` reserved for later implementation
